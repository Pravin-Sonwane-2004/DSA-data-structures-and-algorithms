		Next Bigger Elements are:
		Next bigger element of 5 in the array is: 10
		Next bigger element of 3 in the array is: 10
		Next bigger element of 10 in the array is: 13
		Next bigger element of 9 in the array is: 13
		Next bigger element of 6 in the array is: 13
		Next bigger element of 13 in the array is: -1
		Next Bigger Elements Array:
		10 10 13 13 13 -1
		
	class CheckBiggerElement {
		void main() {
			int [] arr = {5,3,10, 9 ,6 ,13};
			
			for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++) {
			}
		}
